# rpncalc

This lab deals with building an extensible RPN calculator. RPN (Reverse Polish notation) or postfix notation is a way of writing numerical
expressions so that operators follow their operands. This is to be contrasted to infix notation — the notation you are probably more familiar with — in which operators occur between the operands. So rather than writing 1+2 one writes 1 2 +.
